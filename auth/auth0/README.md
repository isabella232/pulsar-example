# Auth0 JWT verification and validation

`Auth0JwtValidator` validates a JWT for Pulsar integration. This is the logic and requirement to validate auth0 JWT in order to generate Pulsar bearer token.

Algorithm 
    supports RSA 256
     public key must be accessible (wget) from https://<your-domain>/.well-known/jwks.json
     your-domain is provided by auth0 in the form of auth0.com
     we use the issuer as `your-domain`


Time validation includes 10 seconds leeway
     iat - issued in a past date < the current timestamp
     exp - expired date > the current timestamp
     nbf - no good before < the current timestamp

Permission authorization
     auth0 API -> Permissions are used for authorization
     produce:topic
     consume:topic

Kafkaeque does not store JWT.
